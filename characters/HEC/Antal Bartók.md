# Early Life
Born in the Transylvanian region in Romania, Antal Bartok and his family 
relocated to a border town in Hungary during Nicolae Ceausescu's 
Romanianization campaign.

(writer's note: I thought giving a bigoted character a backstory of 
being a victim of real-life tragedy involving ethno-national identity 
and categorization.)

Antal Bartok's father, Janos, got a job as the secret police that 
watched over political dissidents - especially those who were 
ubermensch. That made Bartok interested in politics but developed a 
desire for absolute power, and beginning to believe that Socialist 
government not adopting Soviet-style ruling made Hungary worse. Not only 
that, he adopted a very fascistic, ethno-nationalistic worldview that 
Hungarians are superior than any ethnic demographic in Europe, and 
(privately) romanticize the Fascist regime from the past.

(writer's note: Did some research into Goulash Communism. To be honest, 
as an outsider, I was surprised how it's different than American 
perception of Eastern Bloc countries. But if there's someone in Hungary 
who has somewhat a nuanced perspective on that era and how people 
beginning to adopt ultra-nationalist ideology.)

## How he became anti-Ubermensch
To make long story short, he adopted his father's authoritarianism and 
wanted to follow his footstep of becoming a beaucrat that surveils 
ethnic minorities. When Hungarian Eugenics Committee was created during 
the liberalization, he became one of earliest applicants and goes around 
collecting DNA samples from various people.

Despite the sciences resolving around the übermensch, he was a firm 
believer that that can be bred out, so he often conducted research on
the collected DNA samples. He published around 3 books on the subject
by the year 2000, but he was never really taken seriously, and the
studies were littered with errors.

In the year 2000, when the Hungarian wings of White Dawn were formed,
he put his anti-übermensch away in order to "unite against the 
Neobolshevik cabal", but viewed it as a "bother that must be tolerated 
until the victory". By that time, his disdain of the übermensch was also
much more out of jealousy rather than anything else.

data against the intruders. He was killed by a stray bullet, which was
redirected by Lilly Báthory-Nagy.
