# Uberverse
Open-source lore/shared universe

# Basic premise
After WWII, people with supernatural powers have emerged into the public, who were collectively named as "ubermensch". It was also discovered that in some of mythology might be real and these so called ubermensch might be connected to them. The reason for their disappearance is unknown, many blame the Catholic Church in the west and witch hunts. The existence of semi-humans or non-humans with such powers are also confirmed.

The early years of this were spent with magic tricks being used for amusement and crime fighting, later on people with malicious intents also appeared with such powers. This lead to wars on the streets of cities between ubermench, and later many figured out they can manipulate these people to do their biddings...
